3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Describe the dataset using descriptive statistics. Visualize the data using histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots. Identify any patterns or trends in the data. \
4. Generate training and test dataset
5. Removing Identifiers and Feature Scalling
6. Model Selection (We sompare Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random forest model)
7. Training and Evaluation of the chosen model
8. Predict if the customer will stop using the service or decide to continue with new data.
